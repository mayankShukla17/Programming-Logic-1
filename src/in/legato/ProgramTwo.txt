2.Write an algorithm Snake Game

Algorithm
Step1: Firstly we have to create basic designing of Board and Snake.
Step2: Draw the Board where Snake will move.
Step3: Build the logic for Snake.
Step4: Build the logic for moving the snake up,down,left and right.  
Step5: Build the logic for generating the food.
Step6: Build the Game states and loops.
Step7: Build the logic for ending the Game and Conclude it.
